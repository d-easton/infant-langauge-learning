    paragraph_one: "Spoken language and written language have many differences. Writing is a skill that one must actively learn and practice to master, but most babies learn to speak without any formal teaching. Furthermore, language learning is entirely culturally constrained: a baby is capable of learning any language that it has frequent, in-person exposure to. Understanding this process, which experts call language acquisition, is key to understanding this critical stage of childhood development.",
    paragraph_two: "The acoustic inventory used in spoken language is far more variable than what you might find in a phonics textbook. English alone contains many more consonants and vowel sounds than our alphabet represents. The tendency of sounds to blend into each other and to pick up properties of neighboring sounds complicates this matter further. Each language has its own special variation on this problem of variability. When trying to learn a language, babies are faced with what most adults would consider an overwhelming amount of potentially meaningful information.",
    paragraph_three: "Say the word “baby” and pay attention to how your mouth moves. You might notice your lips puckering and releasing around the “b” consonants, or your mouth opening while your tongue holds a downward position on the “y” sound. Linguists call these sounds “<strong>phonemes</strong>;” they are the smallest meaningful units of language. Every language uses a different inventory of phonemes. They are all produced through a complicated and unique arrangement of oral gymnastics. Since phoneme differences are the first linguistic elements that pre-vocal babies begin to understand, they are crucial topics of study.",

    title: "How Babies Learn Langauge",
    subtitle_one: "Words provide understanding",
    subtitle_two: "Statistical thinking",
    subtitle_three: "Linguistic specialization",
    paragraph_one: "Far before they start to babble, babies begin to understand phoneme patterns. These patterns are words. Scientists have learned this from observing how they react to strings of speech. At as early as six months old, babies begin to recognize familiar words. These words provide meaningful breaks in an otherwise confusing speech stream. It might be their name, or a familiar word like “Mama” or “Dada.” In any case, speaking to your baby provides them their first linguistic clues. It is a critical first step in their language acquisition process. ",
    paragraph_two: "How do babies learn words from phonemes? Work from researchers like Patricia Kuhl suggests that babies are remarkably good at statistics-based inference and probability modelling. Babies as young as 4.5 months show an ability to recognize high frequency phonemes—the /b/ sound in “baby,” for instance. From this, they begin to make predictions about what sounds will probably come after that familiar /b/ sound. For instance, an English-speaking baby might notice the “a” sound comes quite often, but the /g/ sound does not. Eventually, they begin to identify discrete chunks of co-occurring phonemes and from there, associate meaning with their newly internalized word.",
    paragraph_three: "Babies come into the world capable of learning any language, but they soon begin to specialize. As they observe data around them, they begin to latch on to the most frequent phonemes and disregard the rest. This leads to interesting comparison in phoneme recognition across cultures; Kuhl found that English-speaking babies get better and better at identifying the difference between R-L sounds, while Japanese-speaking babies get worse. This makes sense, as adult Japanese speakers don't perceive a meaningful difference between the sounds 'R' and 'L'. To them, they are variants (or <strong>allophones</strong>) of the same phoneme. After a period of familiarization, a 'critical period' of linguistic flexibility closes as babies become increasingly adept at their native language.",

    subtitle_two: "The Personal Touch",
    subtitle_three: "Bilingual Babies",
    paragraph_one: "Babies are very capable of learning a language with little assistance. Lessons and coaching are unneccesary; give them ample data and their mental linguistic engines will get a fully developed language up and running in no time! For babies with language impairments or developmental disorders, this process may take longer or require interventive aid. Thankfully, continuing research in language acquisition is leading to insights that will likely improve treatment options.",
    paragraph_two: "Research has clearly shown that babies do not learn well from video or audio content. To learn a language, a baby must hear people speaking that language around it. This personal contact should be consistent in the baby’s life. English babies who interacted for a short period with a Chinese speaker in an experimental setting did show recognition patterns when tested on Chinese phonemes, but this learning faded quickly after face-to-face sessions with the Chinese speaker.",
    paragraph_three: " It is a misconception that babies born into bilingual environments get confused. Babies are actually quite capable of learning multiple native languages, without skill in any of these languages being degraded. They begin to do this by building and maintaining separate phoneme inventories for each language. Therefore, if you are seeking to raise a bilingual baby it is important that the baby have regular, organic contact with native speakers of that language. Videos and brief interactions won't cut it."

    paragraph_one: "The design of my webpage features interactive tabs and card-based text. Because this conforms to frequent patterns of website design, this choice promotes a user-friendly way of digesting information found online. It was a bit tricky to get the information to display to display and animate properly, but I think the reorganization of the material to fit the digital medium makes the important bits of information more accessible to an unfamiliar audience. I largely avoided image and video media as I found it would be difficult to adequately explain all this information while retaining the card-based approach.",
    paragraph_two: "I found myself relying on shorter sentences with less jargon when writing up my information cards. I tried to keep the content of an idea contained in a card, so one does not need to read other cards and topics to understand the information that might be of greatest interest to them. I was a bit worried that I was oversimplifying at times, but I suppose this might be unavoidable when one is facing the double pressure of writing in a digestible, web-based format and when writing for an unfamiliar audience."
